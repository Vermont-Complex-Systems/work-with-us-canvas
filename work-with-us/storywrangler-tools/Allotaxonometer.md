Comparing pairs of zipf-distributed systems.

_Conceptual Strengths & Innovations_: Complex systems are often comprised of types which vary in 'size' over many orders of magnitude, or heavy-tailed distributions. The allotaxonometer tools facilitate the interpretation of such systems by implementing a family of metrics, such as the rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). RTD lets users visually contrast any two ranked lists of heavy-tailed distributions by adjusting a single parameter that tunes up or down the importance of the relative ranks of types.

_Computational Strengths & Innovations:_ The strength of the allotaxonometer tools lies in its computational simplicity; it only requires the count of types to produce a ranked list, from which RTD can be derived for pairs of systems. This simplicity drives the interpretation of the outcome, as the mechanisms by which types vary over many orders of magnitude can be precisely understood. This simple approach allows us to interpret large, ungainly and very different systems such as tweets and retweets on X (previously Twitter) or Wikipedia using the same lens.
